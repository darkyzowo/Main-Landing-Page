# Main-Landing-Page

The first version of the landing page 


Idea will consist where the 2nd animation transform will start an auto type-writer script that's going to introduce me & explain the project.

> Then a pre-made video will appear & auto-play that shows 1 min of gameplay of the actual project.
> Once the video ends, an auto-scroll animation occurs that showcases a button that says "Let's Play!", clicking it will redirect you to the main project page.
